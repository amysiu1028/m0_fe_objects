# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I thought this was pretty straight forward. Only thing new is using [] for key value arrays.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I am okay I think. Not entirely sure if I have it down yet. But usually start morning with doign work, then afternoon gym. But I want to incorporate gym early in the morning.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
How to use for loops and variables altogether well. I want to be able to do it better. Because when I learned on my own for loops confused me.
